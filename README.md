# RPS Challenge

Challenge: Make a playable rock-paper-scissors game using Ruby and Sinatra.

### Installation

Download or clone to your local machine. Then run `bundle` to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

```shell
$ bundle
```

### Usage

To run the server, just run the `app.rb` file...

```shell
$ ruby app.rb
```

You should see that the built-in Sinatra server is running on e.g. port 4567 (check the output to make sure).

Then you can view the app by pointing your browser to `localhost:4567`.
